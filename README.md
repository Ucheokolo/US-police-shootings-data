## Dataset

In the aftermath of George Floyd's death and the rise of black lives matter(BLM) movement, there has been a lot of debate on racially motivated shootings by cops in the US. I decided to look at police shootings data in the US between 2015 and 2020, to gain insight on the demographics of these shootings across the country.
The data for this analyis was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahsen1330/us-police-shootings).

The data contains basic information about the people involved in the shooting e.g. name, age, gender and race. it also contains details of each incident, like date of event, where it happened? how they were shot? did they attack? Were they holding weapons? Did they show any mental illness? Was the policeman wearing a camera/was the incident recorded? Did the suspect flee?


it also contains information on the type of weapon in Possession by suspect at the time of shooting.


## Summary of Findings

With the way the topic of police shooting has been discussed in the media lately, it is quite impressive to see that the rate of these shootings have been in staedy decline since 2015. There seem to be much tendency for males and females within the age of 30 years and 40 years to be suspects in these shootings, in fact they make up most of the shootings in each category, although males are a distant majority in this case.

Across all race on record apart, on average, younger suspects usually below national average tend to be on the run, either by car or foot at the time of shooting. The older population largely are not on the run as the time of shooting. Older white men are most likely not to flee at the time of incident, while in 'other' race category, suspects below 30 years are the most likely to run across all category.Generally their is a higher chance that the suspect fleeing on foot the time of shooting is a black.

It's also interesting to see that whites make up 50% of these shootings and also have a higher number of unarmed suspects involved. there isn't much difference in terms states averages. The difference between the highest and least state averages is 11 years.


## Key Insights for Presentation
